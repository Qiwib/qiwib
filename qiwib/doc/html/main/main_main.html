<h2><div align="center"><u>About QiwiB</u></h2>

QiwiB means <i>Quantum integrator for interacting Bosons</i>.<br><br>
QiwiB is a program for Linux/MacOS to solve the many-body Schr&ouml;dinger equation of interacting bosons in one dimension. It implements the MCTDHB theory [1] in an efficient way to allow effective calculations for hundreds and thousands of particles.<br>
It's aim is to give users the opportunity even without any programming skills to simulate bosons on a quantum level.<br>
QiwiB has been written in GNU Octave and uses its C++ extensions for more time consuming parts of the program.<br><br>
Development has started in 2009 and and 2010 marked the first usable version of QiwiB and since then many more applications has been added to improve the program.<br>
