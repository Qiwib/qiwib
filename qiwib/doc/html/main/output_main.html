<h2><div align="center"><u>Output files</u></h2>

QiwiB creates a lot of output files. Some of them are located in the main output directory and others in its subdirectory <em>time_dep/</em>. They all can be read by any text editors (see the notes for gzipped files).

<h2><a name="time_dep"></a>Files in time_dep/ directory</h2>
The files in this directory are saved after each pa.save_step. [time] will be replaced by the current time in the simulation when the variables are due to be saved. Which files are saved is specified in pa.save_options. Also, the information contained in those files can be read out by a text editor or the plotting programs.
<br>To save disk space all files are gzipped, i.e. use gunzip if you want to see their contents in a text editor or use an editor that supports gzipped text files (some linux editors do).<br><br>
