The QiwiB program package
QiwiB is a program written in GNU Octave (an open source Matlab clone) to solve the many-particle Schroedinger equation in one dimension. At the moment, it simulates the full quantum many-body physics of ultracold bosons. For this, it uses the MCTDHB approach given in the following reference:
O. E. Alon, A. I. Streltsov, and L. S. Cederbaum, Phys. Rev. A 77, 033613 (2008) (link).

QiwiB was originally written by Thomas Ernst under the mentorship of Joachim Brand. It was further developed by members of the CTCP group at Massey University Auckland ([link](http://ctcp.massey.ac.nz?~brand)).

QiwiB is written in Octave and C++. Included in the QiwiB package is a comprehensive HTML manual.

Because QiwiB is still in its early stages, we cannot guarantee it to be completely bug free. If you discover a bug please let us know by filing a bug report in the "Issues" tab.
