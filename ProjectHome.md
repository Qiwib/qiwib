<h1>The QiwiB program package</h1>
<b>QiwiB</b> is a program written in GNU Octave (an open source Matlab clone) to solve the many-particle Schroedinger equation in one dimension. At the moment, it simulates the full quantum many-body physics of ultracold bosons. For this, it uses the MCTDHB approach given in the following reference:<br>
O. E. Alon, A. I. Streltsov, and L. S. Cederbaum, Phys. Rev. A 77, 033613 (2008) (<a href='http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.77.033613'>link</a>).<br>
<br>
QiwiB is developed by members of the CTCP group at Massey University Auckland (<a href='http://ctcp.massey.ac.nz'>link</a>).<br>
<br>
QiwiB is written in Octave and C++. Included in the QiwiB package is a comprehensive HTML manual. See the Wiki pages for more information about QiwiB as well as installation instructions.<br>
<br>
Packaged snapshots of the code, that are considered as stable, can be found in the "Downloads tab", whereas the current development of QiwiB can be followed in the "Source" tab.<br>
<br>
Because QiwiB is still in its early stages, we can not guarantee it to be completely bug free. If you discover a bug please let us know by filing a bug report in the "Issues" tab.<br>
